# Cheezus
A website built with React for a Web-Dev course at university. Nothing groundbreaking, but I moved onto Vue and just Vanilla JS after this experience.
Excuse the cheesy name, the website was built for a fictitious company that sold gourmet cheese.

Gained some experience with CSS, Bootsrap and deployments.
